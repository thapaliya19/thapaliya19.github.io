Hello there! I'm Safal Thapaliya. I am a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII)](https://naamii.org.np/). 
My primary research interests lies in vision-language models, and its applications in medical imaging.
Besides that, I am interested in object detection and image segmentation in low-resource settings.
At NAAMII, my primary research focuses on computer vision applications in medical imaging, under the supervision of [Bishesh Khanal, Ph.D](https://bishesh.github.io/). 
My current research at NAAMII involves medical image segmentation in 2D and 3D medical imaging data, object detection in microscopic images, and vision-language models for medical image segmentation.
 

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).
My bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Aman Shakya, Ph.D](https://lict.ioe.edu.np/profile/aman/) and [Bishesh Khanal, Ph.D](https://bishesh.github.io/), where we identifed the eight most common COVID-19 discussion topics among the Twitter community using the Nepali language, set up an online platform to automatically gather Nepali tweets containing the COVID-19-related keywords, classified the tweets into the eight topics, and visualize the results across the period in a web-based dashboard.
I was a research intern at NAAMII during this period.


I’ve previously worked at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com/), where I was responsible for designing databases, writing REST APIs, and website deployment. 
I also interned at [Logpoint](https://www.logpoint.com/) in the Customer Support and Solutions division, where I was introduced to different aspects of linux system administration.


In my leisure, I love to play and watch football ⚽.
