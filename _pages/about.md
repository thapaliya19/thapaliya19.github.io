Hello there! I'm Safal Thapaliya. I am a Research Assistant at [Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII)](https://naamii.org.np/). 
<!-- My primary research interests lies in vision-language models, and its applications in medical imaging. -->
<!-- Besides that, I am interested in object detection and image segmentation in low-resource settings. -->
At NAAMII, my primary research focuses on computer vision applications in medical imaging, under the supervision of [Bishesh Khanal, Ph.D](https://bishesh.github.io/). 
My research interests lie in self-supervised learning, mechanistic interpretability and explainable AI.
Lately, I have been exploring on ways to leverage vision-language models for explainable and interpretable medical image segmentation.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).
My bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Aman Shakya, Ph.D](https://lict.ioe.edu.np/profile/aman/) and [Bishesh Khanal, Ph.D](https://bishesh.github.io/).

I’ve previously worked at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com/), where I was responsible for designing databases, writing REST APIs, and website deployment. 
I also interned at [Logpoint](https://www.logpoint.com/) in the Customer Support and Solutions division, where I learned to use different tools and techniques for linux system administration.


In my leisure, I love to play and watch football ⚽.
