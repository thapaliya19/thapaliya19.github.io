# About
Hello there. I am Safal Thapaliya. I am a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII)](https://naamii.org.np/). Here, I’m engaged in research involving computer vision problems in low-resource settings.

I’ve previously worked at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com/) as a backend developer. I also interned at [Logpoint](https://www.logpoint.com/) in the Customer Support and Solutions division.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/). 

Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Mathematics, Linux, and Web Development are some of my areas of particular interest. 
I love to play and watch football; I am an FC Barcelona supporter.
