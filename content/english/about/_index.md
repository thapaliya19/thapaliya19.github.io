# About
Hello there! I'm Safal Thapaliya. I am a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII)](https://naamii.org.np/). 
At NAAMII, my primary research focuses on computer vision applications in medical imaging. 
My research involves medical image segmentation in 2D and 3D medical imaging data and object detection in microscopic images.
I've been researching multi-modal vision-language models in medical image segmentation most recently. 

Before joining NAAMII as a Research Assistant, I was involved here as a research intern during my senior year, where I worked on creating a tweet classification dataset for the Nepali language written in the Devanagari script.
Iâ€™ve previously worked at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com/) as a backend developer. 
I also interned at [Logpoint](https://www.logpoint.com/) in the Customer Support and Solutions division.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/). 

Deep Learning, Mathematics, Linux, and Web Development are some of my areas of particular interest. 
I love to play and watch football; I am an FC Barcelona supporter.
