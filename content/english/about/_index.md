# About
Hello there! I'm Safal Thapaliya. I am a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII)](https://naamii.org.np/). 
At NAAMII, my primary research focuses on computer vision applications in medical imaging, under the supervision of [Bishesh Khanal, Ph.D](https://bishesh.github.io/). 
My research involves medical image segmentation in 2D and 3D medical imaging data and object detection in microscopic images.
I've been researching multi-modal vision-language models in medical image segmentation most recently. 

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), where my bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Aman Shakya, Ph.D](https://lict.ioe.edu.np/profile/aman/). 


Before joining NAAMII as a Research Assistant, I was involved here as a research intern during my senior year, where I worked on creating a tweet classification dataset for the Nepali language written in the Devanagari script.
Iâ€™ve previously worked at [Clamphook](https://clamphook.com/) as a backend developer. 
I also interned at [Logpoint](https://www.logpoint.com/) in the Customer Support and Solutions division.


Deep Learning, Mathematics, Linux, and Web Development are some of my areas of particular interest. 
I love to play and watch football; I am an FC Barcelona supporter.
