      <description>Hello there. I am Safal Thapaliya. I recently received my degree in Computer engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus. Currently, I am working at NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for research(NAAMII) as a Research Assistant. Here, I&amp;rsquo;m engaged in studies involving Natural Language Processing and Medical Imaging.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously worked at Clamphook as a backend developer. I built databases and Rest APIs using MongoDB and Flask.
I also worked as an intern at Logpoint in the Customer Support and Solutions division, where I learned about various Linux ideas and distributed log handling techniques.</description>
