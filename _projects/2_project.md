title: Lower Limb Angle Measurement
description: Bone segmentation, landmark detection and angle measurement
importance: 2

- Segmentation, landmark detection, and angle measurement for corrective osteotomy.
- CT scans of the lower limbs were used to segment out parts of pelvis, femur, and tibia bones.
- These segmentations are then used to detect the important landmarks required to measure relevant angles for corrective osteotomy.
- Trained different models like UNet for bone segmentation.
- Set-up an deployment environment using Flask and Docker, to deploy the trained models for segmentation and angle measurement.
- This project was done at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/projects/ai-assisted-microscopy/).
